# Razor:  A Framework for Post-deployment Software Debloating

We proposese a practical debloating framework,
RAZOR, that performs code reduction for deployed binaries.
Based on usersâ€™ specification, Razor customizes the binary
to generate a functional program with the minimal code size.
Instead of only supporting given test cases, RAZOR takes sev-
eral control-flow heuristics to infer complementary code that
are necessary to support user-expected functionalities.

# More data sets will be released soon.
